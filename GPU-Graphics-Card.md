## Graphics Card
#### AKA Display Card, Video Card, Display Adapter, or Graphics Adapter
A graphics card is an expansion card which generates a large quanity of output images to a display on a computer computer monitor or laptop screen.
At the core of it is the graphics processing unit (GPU), which is the main part that does the actual computations. A GPU is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly utilize and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images to output to a display device. This should not be confused as the graphics card as a whole but sometimes it is referred to  as "graphics card". GPUs also remove stress from CPU's by performing additional processing for the system.

GPUs are used in embedded systems (digital cameras, calculators), mobile phones, personal computers, workstations (beefer PCs used for professional use), and game consoles.

To install the GPU you would need to locate the the PCIe x16 slot on the motherboard and remove the slot covers if any. Then you would need to align the GPU with the slot and press firmly until you feel it click. After that you can plug in any of the required PCIe power cables from the PSU.
