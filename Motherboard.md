## Motherboard
#### AKA Mainboard, System Board, Baseboard, Planar Board or Logic Board, or mobo

To start setting up, first gather all the necessary tools (at least a **screwdriver**) and components and make sure your building area is flat, clean, and static free. Static can damage your components, so make sure to ground yourself by touching metal first.

Get out the motherboard and place it on the surface. This printed circuit board (**PCB**) is the main one found in PCs and is usally the largest. This holds and allows communication between many of the components of the machine, such as the **CPU** and **RAM**, and provides connectors for the **peripherals**.
