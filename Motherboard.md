## Motherboard
#### AKA Mainboard, System Board, Baseboard, Planar Board or Logic Board, or mobo
A motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) found in general 
purpose microcomputers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides 
connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems such as the central processor, the chipsetâ€™s input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and other 
components integrated for general purpose use.
