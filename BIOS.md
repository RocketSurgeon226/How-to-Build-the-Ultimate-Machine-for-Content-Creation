### Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)
#### AKA System BIOS, ROM BIOS, PC BIOS
BIOS is non-volatile (safe when turned off) firmware used to perform hardware (fully built PC for example) initialization during the booting process of a computer, and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. 
The BIOS firmware comes pre-installed on a PC's system board, and it is the first software to run when powered on. 
The BIOS initializes and tests the system hardware components, and loads a boot loader from a mass memory device which then initializes an operating system. 

Most BIOS implementations are specifically designed to work with a particular computer or motherboard model, by interfacing with various devices that make up the complementary system chipset. 
The BIOS contents are stored on flash memory so it can be rewritten without removing the chip from the motherboard. 
This allows easy, end-user updates to the BIOS firmware so new features can be added or bugs can be fixed, but it also creates a possibility for the computer to become infected with BIOS rootkits. 
When  a BIOS upgrades, it could fail can brick the motherboard permanently, unless the system includes some form of backup.

Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a successor to BIOS, aiming to address its technical shortcomings.

After you installed all of the hardware into the case, you can pwer up the PC to enter the BIOS. To do this you would normally need to press the "Delete" or "F2" key. The BIOS will boot up and from there you can check the internal PC temperatures, the hardware components dectected, and the speeds of the fans.

Finally you can install Windows or Linux drivers (I'd perfer Windows beacuse it is easier) from a bootable USB, You can buy these drivers at "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download" and "https://www.shoplinuxonline.com/"
