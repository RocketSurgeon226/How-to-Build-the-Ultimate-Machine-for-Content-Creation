## Case
#### AKA Chassis, Tower, System Unit, Cabinet
To fully assemble the PC you will need to place and organize all of the componets into a **case**. A case, is the enclosure that contains most of the components of a computer (usually excluding the peripherals).

First install the **I/O shield** (metal plate that covers the ports) inside the case. Align the **motherboard** holes with the standoffs in the case. Ensure its I/O ports match with the I/O shield. Then tighten the screws on the motherboard gently to the standoffs to avoid damage.

Next, depending if you have a M.2  SSD or SATA SSD/HDD do the following: 
*For **M.2 SSD**: insert the drive into the M.2 slot and secure it with a screw; it does not need a power cable
*For **SATA SSD/HDD**: slide them into the drive bays and secure them with screws; connect the SATA power and data cables

Next, place the **PSU** at the bottom or top of the case with the fan facing outward for airflow. Connect the cables specifiesd in the [PSU](PSU.md) section.

Next, screw in the **GPU** inside the case and plug in the **PCIe** cable from the PSU.

Next, mount the **fans** for ther intake (front) and exhaust (back/top) and test the airflow directions for efficient cooling.

Finally, use cable wrap tubes or tie-downs to organize the cables in your case to keep the cables tidy and to avoid blocking airflow.
