## Power Supply Unit (PSU) 
A **power supply unit (PSU)** converts the building's (mains) AC (alternating current) to low-voltage regulated DC (direct current) power for the main components of the computer. Some power supplies have a manual switch for selecting the correct input voltage, while others automatically adapt to the mains voltage, usually called switch mode. PCs use the latter. 

Most desktop PCs power supplies now and days conform to the **ATX (Advanced Technology Extended) specification**, which includes form factor and voltage tolerances. While an ATX power supply is connected to the mains supply, it always provides a 5 Volt standby (5VSB) voltage so that the standby functions on the computer and certain peripherals are powered. The motherboard turns on and off the ATX power supplies using a signal. They also provide a signal to the motherboard to indicate when the DC voltages are functioning properly, so that the computer is able to safely power on and boot up.

To configure the PSU you would need to connect the **24 pin** and **8 pin CPU cables** that came with the PSU to the **motherboard**. You may require additional **GPU** or **peripheral cables**.
