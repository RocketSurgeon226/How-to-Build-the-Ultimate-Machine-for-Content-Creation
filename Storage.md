## Data Storage
#### AKA Digital Data
Data storage is the recording and retreiving of information in a storage medium using electrical power. 

A hard disk drive (HDD, AKA hard disk, hard drive, or fixed disk) is an electromechanical data storage device that uses magnetic storage to store and retrieve digital information using one or more rotating disks coated with magnetic material. The disks are connected to magnetic heads on a moving actuator arms, which read and write data to the surface of the disks. Data is stored and retrieved in a random access manner, not having to be accessed in any type of order. HDDs are non-volatile storge which can retain stored data when the system is off. These are more affordable compared to SSDs but they offer less storage, less performance, have a lower lifespan, and are more susceptible to mechanical wear and tear over time compared to SSDs.

A solid-state drive (SSD, AKA solid-state disk) is a storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data continuously. SSDs are compatible with traditional block input/output (I/O) HDD connectors, which  is an easy swap to swich storage options and replacements. SSDs have no moving mechanical parts so they are resistant to physical shock, run silently, have quicker access time, and lower latency compared to HDDs. The only downside is SSDs are still more expansive than HDDs.
