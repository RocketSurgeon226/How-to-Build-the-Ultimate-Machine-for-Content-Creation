## Cooling 
Computer cooling is required to remove the waste heat produced by the machine's components, to keep components within safe operating temperature limits. Components that are susceptible to temporary malfunction or permanent 
failure if overheated include CPUs, chipset, graphics cards, and hard disk drives (HDDs). These components are designed to generate as little heat as possible, but more heat may still be produced if cooling components are not incorperated. To solve this problem you will need to include a heatsink and a fan to rectify the excess heat.

A heatsink uses airflow from its fan to reduce the temperature rise produced by the components giving off excess heat. To attach the the heatskink you would need to first apply and spread a pea-sized amount of thermal paste onto the CPU. Then you would need to mount the heatskink onto the CPU, ensuring even contact. Screw it in using the provided brackets. Next, plug the CPU fan into the "CPU_FAN" header on the motherboard. Fans used for the entire PC are used in tandem with the heatsink fan to exhaust the hot air from the entire machine.

Another advanced and expensive option is to apply liquid cooling.
