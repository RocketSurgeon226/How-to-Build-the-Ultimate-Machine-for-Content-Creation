## Central Processing Unit (CPU)

Next you will need to install the CPU onto the motherboard. A CPU (central processing unit) is the electronic circuitry within a machine that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control, and 
input/output (I/O) operations specified by the operating syetem (OS) chosen.

To do this you will need to unlock the CPU socket by liftinging up the latch or lever. This is normally near the center of the board.

Then you will gently place the CPU into the socket by aligning its notches with the socket. This should fit like a glove, no extra force needed.

Finally lower the latch or lever and to secure the CPU.
