## Random Access Memory (RAM)

Next, you will need to install the RAM. **RAM** **(Random Access Memory)** is a type of data storage that stores data and machine code temporarily, until the **CPU** needs to process the data and code. This also holds data and machine code until the PC is turned off. This allows data to be read or written in almost the same amount of time regardless of its physical location within the memory. The slots for this are normally right next to the CPU socket.

Push down the latches at the ends of the slots. Line up the notches on the RAM with the slots and press down firmly until the RAM clicks into place, making sure it is embedded fully.
